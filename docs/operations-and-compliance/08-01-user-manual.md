## 1. Audience & Prerequisites

This manual is for the operator of the Trading Platform — typically a quantitative trader or quant developer running the platform on a local workstation or a cloud VM. Readers are expected to be comfortable with the Rust toolchain (for the engine), Bun (for the frontend), and basic Linux shell commands.

Hardware target: any 64-bit Linux/macOS machine capable of running a Rust binary and an Axum HTTP server. No GPU is required. Memory footprint at idle is ~150 MB; under live load it scales with the number of active Market Instances (4 timeframe pipelines each).

Software prerequisites:
- Rust toolchain (stable; `rustup` recommended)
- Bun ≥ 1.0
- SQLite (the engine creates `./telemetry.db` automatically)
- A POSIX shell for `./manage.sh` shortcuts

---

## 2. Installation & First Run

The project is a Cargo workspace with a Svelte 5 frontend in `ui/`. The **order of build matters**: the frontend must be built before the engine binary starts, because the engine serves `ui/dist/` as static assets.

```bash
# From workspace root:
cd ui
bun install
bun run build
cd ../..
cargo run --bin execution-daemon -- --web
```

The engine reads `config.toml` from the workspace root on startup. **If `config.toml` is missing entirely**, the `manage.sh` first-run flow scaffolds a default from the documented schema before the binary launches (one-shot bootstrap — repeat invocations leave an existing `config.toml` untouched). **If `config.toml` exists but is malformed**, the binary panics with a descriptive error and the operator must fix the file before the next start — there is no automatic re-scaffolding on parse failure (a corrupt-but-existing file might contain deliberate operator edits, so re-scaffolding would risk silently overwriting them). Legacy `config.json` is still recognized by `load_config()` as a fallback for existing installations; new deploys should use `config.toml`.

---

## 3. Launch Modes

The project ships a convenience wrapper (`./manage.sh`):

| Command | Mode | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `./manage.sh run` | Web (GUI) | Foreground with live logs; dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. |
| `./manage.sh run-silent` | Web (GUI, background) | Daemonized; logs to `engine.log`. |
| `./manage.sh stop` | — | Stop the background engine instance. |
| `./manage.sh status` | — | Print process uptime. |
| `./manage.sh test` | All tests | Run TEST-CORE → TEST-ENGINE → TEST-UI sequentially (~18 s). |
| `./manage.sh test-core` | Pure math / indicators | Run only TEST-CORE (<3 s). |
| `./manage.sh test-engine` | DB, server, failover | Run only TEST-ENGINE (<10 s). |
| `./manage.sh test-ui` | Svelte 5 runes / components | Run only TEST-UI (<10 s). |

Headless cloud operation is supported by running the same binary without `--web` and applying a pre-validated `config.toml` (see [Global Architecture §4](../conceptual-foundations/01-02-global-architecture.md)).

## 4. Dashboard Walkthrough

The Svelte 5 dashboard is organized around three levels of navigation:

1. **Sidebar** — Engine selector (Home / Data Infrastructure / Market Monitoring / Trade Automation / Portfolio Management / Performance Analytics) + per-pair workspace list with live price, 24 h change, and pause/delete controls.
2. **Tab Header** — Contextual tabs per active engine: Workspace / Overview / Settings for the Market engine; for an open Market Instance the tabs are `Charts / Metrics / Alignment / Opportunities / Risks / Analysis / Recommendation`. Liquidation-cluster heatmap and cascade-risk data render **inline on the Charts tab** (the standalone Liquidity tab was removed in v6.0; `07-04` is retained for history only). Connection Quality lives under the **Data Infrastructure** engine's Connectivity panel (see [`08-05-connection-quality.md`](../operations-and-compliance/08-05-connection-quality.md)). The Recommendation tab is the **discretionary-trader view** — it lists the trade setups the engine has identified (one card per qualifying `OpportunityMatrix.profiles` entry) alongside the macro verdict; it never issues a single "best" trade for an automated system (the TAE is out of scope for the Market Monitor).
3. **Main Viewport** — Renders the active tab. Each panel is a thin Svelte component with a companion CSS module per the project's CSS conventions.

For architectural details see [UI Overview](../ui-ux/07-01-ui-overview-spec.md) and [Dashboard Layout](../ui-ux/07-02-ui-dashboard-layout.md).

## 5. Configuring Engines & Timeframes

The single source of configuration truth is `config.toml` at the workspace root (legacy `config.json` is still recognized as a fallback by `load_config()` for existing installations). It controls:

- `candles.duration_seconds` — base (micro) timeframe
- `fast_timeframe`, `slow_timeframe`, `macro_timeframe` — additional timeframe tiers, each with `enabled` and `duration_seconds`
- `indicators.<name>.<param>` — per-indicator lookback, threshold, smoothing window, etc.
- `risk_per_trade_pct`, `leverage.cross_leverage`, `safety.*` — risk and safety gates
- `symbols` — list of `Exchange:Symbol` instruments to ingest
- `execution_policies` — user-defined rules (see [TAE Execution Policy](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-04-tae-execution-policy-spec.md))

For the 4-tier timeframe model and UTC alignment rules see [Timeframe Model](../conceptual-foundations/01-04-timeframe-model.md).

The full configuration can be inspected via `GET /api/config` (returns the parsed `AppConfig`) and updated via `POST /api/config` (writes back to `config.toml` **explicitly**; the API is the only path that mutates `config.toml` on disk). Routine GUI runtime edits (e.g. changing a risk profile or paper balance) do **not** auto-overwrite `config.toml` — those edits are persisted to the `risk_profiles` and `paper_balances` DB tables per the precedence rules in [06-02-database-schema-spec.md §3](../integration-and-api/06-02-database-schema-spec.md).

---

## 6. Running & Monitoring Trades

**Paper vs Live.** The default mode is paper trading — orders are routed to the internal matching engine described in [Paper Trading Spec](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-05-tae-paper-trading-spec.md). **Live credentials must be entered into the encrypted `exchange_keys` SQLite table, not into `config.toml`.** `config.toml` holds no secret material. The encrypted-key management flow uses `POST /api/keys` (encrypt with `EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY`) and the master key is loaded from the same-named environment variable at engine start. See [Database Schema §3.5](../integration-and-api/06-02-database-schema-spec.md) for the column schema and encryption contract.

**Reading the Recommendation tab.** The Recommendation Matrix (`AdvisoryMatrix` + `DecisionContext`) is delivered per Market Instance on the WebSocket envelope (`/ws`). Open a Market Instance, switch to the **Recommendation** tab, and you will see —

- a single environment header (color-coded by `directional_guidance` family: Red = bearish, Green = bullish, Amber = neutral; see [07-06-ui-color-conventions.md](../ui-ux/07-06-ui-color-conventions.md)) listing `market_stance`, `strategy_environment`, `confidence_assessment` and the entry-danger band,
- a top-call hero showing the rank argmax (LONG / SHORT / HOLD) with the runner-up probabilities,
- a safety-flags row of 5 chips (Trade Readiness, Internal R:R, Risk-Adjusted R:R, Stop-Loss %, Confidence),
- a **trade recommendations list** of up to 5 cards — one per qualifying `OpportunityMatrix.profiles` entry (`preconditions_met > 0`) — each tagged with its trade direction (LONG / SHORT) so the operator can pick,
- a "Why" bullet list of the top-3 rationale lines derived from `decisionRank.ts::buildRationale`,
- a verbatim `final_recommendation` quote block from the Rust advisory layer.

The Recommendation tab is **read-only** — it never places orders. The Trade Automation Engine (TAE), when configured, consumes the same `AdvisoryMatrix` via the [Policy Matrix contract](../matrices/02-04-decision-matrix.md). Both consumers should agree on the directional verdict because they read the same wire payload; if the TAE's policy surface is unset (Market-Monitor-only installation, which is the supported mode), the Recommendation tab is the *only* signal channel and the operator trades manually on its output. See [`03-02-07-mme-layer6-decision-support.md §6`](../engines/market-monitoring-engine/03-02-07-mme-layer6-decision-support.md) for the no-autonomous-execution guarantee and [`docs/README.md` §The Five Engines`](../../README.md) for the broader Market-Monitor-vs-TAE split.

**Programming an instance (start/pause/stop automation).** Each instance supports optional automation via a `[instances.<id>.automation]` block in `config.toml` (or the equivalent inline edit affordance in the Workspaces Sidebar). You can arm independent `start`, `pause`, and `stop` conditions using `at_price_above`, `at_price_below`, `at_time` (RFC3339 UTC), or `after_duration_secs` (pause/stop only, measured from the most recent transition into RUNNING). Multiple keys inside one condition are OR — first to fire wins. Editing any key re-arms that condition; saving a past `at_time` returns `422`. Manual `/start`/`/pause`/`/stop` commands are always available regardless of automation configuration (operator supremacy), and `DELETE` on a non-STOPPED instance returns `409`. See [03-03-06-tae-instance-lifecycle-spec.md §3/§4](../engines/trade-automation-engine/03-03-06-tae-instance-lifecycle-spec.md).

**Reading the Portfolio.** Active positions, margin usage, and the safety veto status are visible in the "Portfolio" sidebar entry. The PME's Ontological Priority Veto overrides the TAE's active stances when systemic thresholds are breached — see [PME Layer 4](../engines/portfolio-management-engine/03-04-05-pme-layer4-portfolio.md) for the trigger conditions.

**Trade journal.** All closed trades are written to `paper_trades` and `trade_telemetry_history`. Human annotations go into `trade_learning_journal`. Exposes via `GET /api/trade-journal/export/csv` and `/api/trade-journal/export/json`.

## 7. Telemetry & Logs

| Channel | Location | Contents |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Live log | `engine.log` | Engine stdout/stderr when running via `./manage.sh run-silent`. |
| Snapshot history | `./telemetry.db` (SQLite) | One row per completed candle; retention configurable (default 7 days). |
| Equity history | `./telemetry.db` `portfolio_equity_history` | 60-s cadence snapshots; retention 30 days. |
| Trade archive | `./telemetry.db` `paper_trades`, `trade_telemetry_history` | Closed-trade ledger. |
| Connection quality | `./telemetry.db` `connection_quality_samples` | Rolling 1h / 6h / 24h windows; retention configurable (default 7 days); served by `GET /api/connection-quality`. |
| Decision observability | `GET /api/system/observability` | Recent triggered policies and completed trades. |
| Engine heartbeat | `GET /api/system/status` | Connection state, observation_loop_latency_ms, ingest_skew_ms, system_heartbeat_latency_ms, active_pairs_count. |

### 7.1 Retention configuration (Ops Phase 1)

v6.0 ships with hard-coded retention windows; Ops Phase 1 makes them configurable via a `[retention]` block in `config.toml`:

```toml
[retention]
market_snapshots_days = 7        # default
connection_quality_samples_days = 7  # default
portfolio_equity_history_days = 30   # default
```

A value of `0` disables the cleanup loop for that table (rows accumulate indefinitely; operator is responsible for `VACUUM` and disk usage). Negative values are rejected at startup.

**Until Ops Phase 1 ships:** the hard-coded defaults (7/7/30) are documented above; editing them requires modifying `crates/database-storage/src/logger.rs`.

## 8. Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Engine panics on startup with "config not found" | No `config.toml` (and no legacy `config.json` fallback) at workspace root | Run `./manage.sh` once; it scaffolds a default. Or copy `config.example.toml`. |
| WebSocket frames never arrive | `ui/dist/` is missing or empty | Rebuild frontend (`cd ui && bun run build`). |
| All values `null` in dashboard | Initial warm-up not finished | Wait `analysis_limit × duration_seconds` (default 500 × 60 s ≈ 8 h on micro); reduce `analysis_limit` for faster warm-up at the cost of less history. |
| `margin_usage_ratio > 95%` warning | Position size too large for current equity | Reduce `max_position_size_usd` in policy or close a position. |
| Indicator shows but `signals` array is empty | Indicators warmed up but no SignalKind conditions are firing yet | Verify thresholds in `config.toml` `[indicators.*]`; check the indicator rulebook via `GET /api/rules`. |
| Connectivity warning on a specific exchange | Adapter is in backoff after repeated disconnects | Check `/api/system/status`; permanent disable after 5 consecutive failed cycles (a cycle = a full backoff sequence; a failure = one attempt), shown as "5 consecutive failures" (supervisor must be restarted). |
| SQLite "database is locked" errors | Long-running query holding a write transaction | Reduce log retention or query frequency; the WAL mode is already enabled. |
| Veto stuck at `AVOID` for a symbol | PME safety trigger fired; threshold must clear | Inspect portfolio equity vs. peak; check `systemic_risk_score`; follow the [PME veto release procedure](../engines/portfolio-management-engine/03-04-05-pme-layer4-portfolio.md#43-veto-release). |

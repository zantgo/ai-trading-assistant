//! HL ↔ Bitget pipeline parity integration tests.
//!
//! The audit confirmed that both Hyperliquid and Bitget share the
//! same injection code paths in `analyzer::run_single`: the
//! `inject_derivatives_indicators` and `inject_orderbook_indicators`
//! helpers are exchange-agnostic. They are exercised here with
//! synthetic `NormalizedEvent` payloads that mirror what each adapter
//! produces on the wire, and the resulting indicator map keys are
//! asserted against the registry. If both exchanges emit identical
//! event shapes (which they do), the indicator maps are identical.
//!
//! This is the single highest-leverage test for catching a future
//! regression that would make HL and Bitget diverge — e.g., someone
//! adds a `if exchange == Hyperliquid { ... }` branch to the inject
//! helpers, or someone adds a Bitget-only indicator without
//! registering its HL counterpart. The two tests run side-by-side
//! with the same synthetic events and the same assertions.
